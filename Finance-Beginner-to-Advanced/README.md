# Finance Industry - SQL Project

This project is a SQL-based financial database designed for my portfolio. It includes customer accounts, transactions, and investments, making it suitable for practicing SQL queries ranging from beginner to advanced levels.

## Datasets

The project contains four datasets, each stored as a CSV file - [Download dataset](https://github.com/amgfigueiredo/Projects/tree/8ad354134f5df79b8acc5e0d932b4724d5da8eee/SQL/Finance/dataset)

- **customers.csv**: Contains customer details.

- **accounts.csv**: Stores account information.

- **transactions.csv**: Records financial transactions.

- **investments.csv**: Includes investment data.
